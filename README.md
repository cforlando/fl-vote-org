The [Tabs on Tallahassee Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Orlando/events/227297615/) at Canvs Orlando, FL on Jan. 16, 2016 inspired this project. The goal of the Hackathon was to use the new [Tabs on Tallahassee API](https://tabsontallahassee.com/api/) to build a digital tool that makes data from the Florida House and/or Senate easier to access and that will help everyday citizens find legislation that matters to them.

Our team created a website, FLVote.org, to harness Twitter to influence Bills in the Florida Legislature. The website works with 3 easy steps:
 1. Pick the Bill
 2. Vote Yes or No to create your tweet
 3. Share it on Twitter

The website also presents a tally of Yes and No tweets for each State Bill.
