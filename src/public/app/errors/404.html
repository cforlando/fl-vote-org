            <li>Well, there's just so many possibilities.</li>
            <li>The link you clicked might be old and does not work anymore.</li>
            <li>Or you might have accidentally typed the wrong URL in the address bar.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What can you do?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You might try retyping the URL and trying again.</li>
